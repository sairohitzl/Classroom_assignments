No one wants to spend their Saturday stalking the farmers market for beautiful berries that 
are moldy come Monday. These tips on how to store strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and 
blackberries will help you to mitigate the madness of quickly perishing produce once and for 
all. With just a little extra effort up front, you’ll save money, prevent food waste, and keep
 your berries fresh long enough to enjoy them out of hand or ready to use in berry desserts
  and treats all season long.

Select the best berries from the bunch Whether you’re purchasing them from your farmers market
 or local grocery store or picking them yourself, selecting the best berries is key to their
  longevity. Because berries are fragile fruits that are thin-skinned, one bad berry can turn 
  the whole bunch. Pick out and discard any that are already bruised, slimy, or spoiled. 
  If you’re noticing blackberry stains on the clamshell container, or strawberry juices 
  pooling at the bottom of the carton, it’s a good indicator that there are a couple berries 
  past their prime in the mix. Instead, seek out firm, plump, shiny berries. If you’ve already 
  got some squished berries on hand, don’t waste them: Save them for smoothies, make a breezy 
  berry compote to top pancakes, or soak and mash in rum for a tangy, syrupy ice cream topping.
